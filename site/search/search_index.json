Purpose The goal of Linigu is to provide SageMath with the functionality to compute various zeta functions associated with hyperplane arrangements. Included are common constructions for hyperplane arrangements and specializations of the flag Hilbert\u2013Poincar\u00e9 series defined in Maglione\u2013Voll. Mathematical details are given in Maglione\u2013Voll. We outline the functions included in Linigu and provide example cases. Setup The simplest way to install Linigu is to run the following $ sage -pip install linigu Linigu has no external dependencies and is compatible with SageMath 9.2 . Funding This package is funded in part by DFG grant 373111162 .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#linigu","text":"Download the source files: Linigu repo .","title":"Linigu"},{"location":"#purpose","text":"The goal of Linigu is to provide SageMath with the functionality to compute various zeta functions associated with hyperplane arrangements.
