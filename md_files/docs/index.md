# Linigu

Documentation for the [Linigu](https://github.com/joshmaglione/linigu) package for SageMath.

## Purpose

The goal of Linigu is to provide SageMath with the functionality to compute various zeta functions associated with hyperplane arrangements. Included are common constructions for hyperplane arrangements and specializations of the flag Hilbert&ndash;Poincar&#233; series defined in Maglione&ndash;Voll. Mathematical details are given in Maglione&ndash;Voll. We outline the functions included in Linigu and provide example cases. 

## Setup

The simplest way to install Linigu is to run the following 

```bash
$ sage -pip install linigu
```

Linigu has no external dependencies and is compatible with [SageMath 9.2](https://www.sagemath.org/).

## Importing

Import LinIgu during your SageMath run with the following

```python
import linigu as li
```

Throughout we use `li` for the reference name of `linigu`.

## Funding 

This package is funded in part by DFG grant [373111162](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/373111162?language=en).
